1. How do I approach designing software?

	I try to approach designing my software by giving it a modular design. This starts by breaking down what is needed to be done into pieces and then coding one or more    	functions to work together to achieve each piece of the project.

2. How do I approach developing programs?

	I try to approach developing my programs by creating them in blocks. The first block is always the minimum requirements to consider my project working. Its a barebones 	version of the project. Once that is complete and working, I begin to add additional blocks. For example, one block might be more advanced functionality, visual design 	or testing. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

	My goal is to complete my computer science degree and pursue a career in software development. Completing this courses allows me to not only grow closer to my degree 	but also teaches me valuable skills that I'm sure will come in handy throughout my career.
